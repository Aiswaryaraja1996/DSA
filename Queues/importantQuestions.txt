Implementation of stack using two queues
----------------------------------------

Making Push() Costly O(n)
---------------------------
push() operation : 

Let X be the element to be pushed inside S.
1.  Enqueue X to q2
2.  Dequeue all the elements from q1 one by one 
    and enqueue to q2 in the order they are dequeued from q1
3.  Swap the names of q1 and q2

Pop() operation :

1.  As top of stack is always maintained at the front of q1 hence, 
    dequeue the front of q1 and return it.


Making Pop() Costly O(n)
---------------------------

Push() operation :

Let X be the element to be pushed inside S.
1.  Enqueue X to q1

Pop() operation :

1.  One by one dequeue all the elements of q1 except the last one and enqueue to q2
2.  The last item of q1 is the required top of stack. Dequeue and return it
3.  Swap the names of q1 and q2
