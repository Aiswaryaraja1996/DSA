QUEUES
------

- Queue is a linear data structure.
- It operates in FIFO (First In First Out).
- The point at which data is entered into queue is called REAR.
- The point at which data is removed from queue is called FRONT.
- The two operations on queue are :
    1.Enqueue : Adding element into queue.
    2.Dequeue : REmoving element from the queue.
- Time Complexity of both operations are O(n).
- Space Complexity of O(n) is required to add n elements in a queue.
- When a queue is full no further elements can be added into queue this condition 
    is called OVERFLOW.
- When a queue is empty no further elements can be deleted from the queue this condition 
    is called UNDERFLOW.

- In Javascript we have push and shift operation to perform Enqueue and Dequeue.
- push()    
    : Add an element to the end of array.
    : Time Complexity O(n).
    : Returns the new length of array.

- shift()
    : Removes the element at the zeroeth index and shifts the values at consecutive indexes down
    : Returns the removed element.
    : undefined, if the array is empty.
    : Time Complexity O(n)
